**CV Builder Application**

I built this application to begin learning the ins-and-outs of React. 

The biggest takeaways I had were learning how to lift states and pass functions/state into other functional components. During this project, I attempted to useState in some of these components but began to realize the importance of keeping my state in a higher position so it is more easily accessible by other components. 

I also learned how to incorporate the html2pdf dependency into my project to turn my HTML resume template into a pdf for users to download. 

Example image of a resume my App produces:
